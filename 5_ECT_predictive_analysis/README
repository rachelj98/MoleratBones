This directory details the step for reproducing the Euler Characteristic Transform (ECT) predictive analysis.

The analysis is divided into 3 different stages:

1) Directory 'ECT_computation_scripts' contains the scripts for computing the Euler Characteristic Transform

2) Directory 'data_processing' contains the scripts that compute the summary statistics from the Euler Characteristic Transform, and merges them with the labels.

This step takes as the input the two folders
"femora"
and
"vertrabrae"

that contain the ECT curves computed in stage 1. *Note that these files are not .OFF files even if their name suggests so.  

We also have the 2 .csv files that contain the data headers (whether or not the bone was from a queen)

The scripts processing_femurs.R and processing_vertrabrae.R reproduce the two files .Rmd files "femurdata" and "LumbarData" that contain the data we fit our model with.

3) The directory classification_scripts fits the SVM models to the data, and computes the p-values for the classification rates.

It uses the two .Rmd files "femurdata" and "LumbarData" that were generated in step 2. There are 3 .R files in the main directory, one for each classification.

Note that running these scripts is computationally expensive, so it is not recommended that one tries to run it in one go.

For this reason, we store the classification rate for each permutation in a file.

The script pvaluescript.R uses these files to compute the p-values from the classification rates. The same script is used for all of the analyses.
